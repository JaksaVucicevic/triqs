Version 1.2.1
----------------

* boost mpi is no longer detected by triqs. 
 You can either add 2 lines to
 detect it in CMake, or port your apps to triqs::mpi.
 To port an apps using mpi :

 detect boost mpi lib, and link to it, using e.g. in CMakeLists :

  find_package(Boost ${BOOST_VERSION} REQUIRED COMPONENTS mpi serialization system)
  link_libraries(${Boost_LIBRARIES})

 include "boost/mpi.hpp" if needed.

* 





From version 1.0 to 1.2

C++
----

* new wrapping of boost random generators. No effect on API.



Python
----------

* New wrapper tool to glue C++ and python. Cython is gone.

gf:
 
 * transpose method now returns a NEW green function, like conjugate, etc...

tail : 

 * Suppress the possibility to save/load in h5 for a tail alone (must be part
   of a gf). [ok ?]
